# COM6911-DTI-2021

This repository is created to facilitate collaboration and code management between team members in COM6911 DTI 
Industrial Project.

## Team tasks

- Team Charlie: Matrix factorization (RecSys) for DTI.
- Team Delta: Different splitting/clustering of the DTI datasets.

## Collaboration

For better team collaboration, you can leverage the Github to mange the team code and develop in parallel. The project 
development can be split into multiple subtasks and each team member can develop your own part on the specific task 
branch, then all of your work on different branches can be merged into the same master branch.

- Create a branch based on the latest master with a descriptive name on your team name + what you plan to do 
  such as `Charlie-ALS`.
  
- Create a pull request (PR) from the task branch above to the master branch after your development is done.

## Notes

- The repository contains two folders `Charlie` and `Delta`, please develop your own team project under the corresponding 
  team folder.
  
- Please do not push the original DTI data or other large files. The remote repository should only contain your team code and
report notebook.
  
- Please do not directly push any commits into `master` branch. The master should keep clean and all changes should be
merged by submitting PR.
